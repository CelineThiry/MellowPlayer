## Welcome to the MellowPlayer's API reference

This documentation contains the MellowPlayer Library API Reference. 

MellowPlayer exposes an API that makes the bridge between the application and the plugins. This is where the
various plugins intefaces are declared and where you'll find an API to interact with the application.
